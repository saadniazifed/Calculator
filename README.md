* Displaying of the result is shown in the calculator's div display upfront.

## Known Bugs
None. Everything was fixed before deployment.

## Reflections
Calculator was the toughest project for me to work in the Foundations section of The Odin Project. Mainly because it's scope, problem solving, functions, everything combining the calculator was magnanimous. It made me think outside the box like a programmer. I learned tremendously how to break down the problem into multiple sub-problems and asking well-thought-out questions from The Odin community's discord group.
